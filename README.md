# How to use the github repository
Clone code from github
In Rstudio, go to File -> New Project -> Version Control -> git -> then add the link for the github repo (repo url link), and a name for the folder that will be created. This will create an RStudio project synced with the git repo. After that's setup, then open the r file that is related to the analysis you want to run. 

# Documentation
There is documentation in the Documents folder on how to use github and rstudio. Within the folder are "Cheatsheets" for Rstudio on understanding Markdown files and other coding logistics. 
There is a file that details how to use the Rmarkdown file for the GL_and_Budget_vs_Actuals file.
