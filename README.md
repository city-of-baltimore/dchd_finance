# How to use the github repository
Clone code from github
In Rstudio, go to File -> New Project -> Version Control -> git -> then add the link for the github repo (repo url link), and a name for the folder that will be created. This will create an RStudio project synced with the git repo. After that's setup, then open the r file that is related to the analysis you want to run. 

# Documentation
There is documentation in the Documents folder on how to use github and rstudio. Within the folder are "Cheatsheets" for Rstudio on understanding Markdown files and other coding logistics. 

There is a file that details how to use the Rmarkdown file for the GL_and_Budget_vs_Actuals file and there is a file that talks about how to use Github.

Make sure to click on the "View Raw" to have the file be downloaded to your downloads folder to take a look at the files.  

# Deputy Plot Scripts
This folder contains rmd files that are used to create the plots for specific deputies that corolate to each call center. The files will make three different plots. 

  1. Cost center negative spending plot
  2. Cost center negative spending drilled down to the spend category
  3. Total spending for the month of July

# Summer and All Service Names Plots
This is a rmd file that contains statcked and regular bar charts to compare the various tables under the 1001 General and 5000 State Grants data.

1. Salaries/OPC Projections and,
